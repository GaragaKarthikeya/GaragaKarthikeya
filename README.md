# hey, I'm Karthikeya

I'm 18. I study ECE at IIIT Bangalore.  
Second year. Not an expert. Still very much learning.  

Mostly curious about how code and hardware connect. I like systems that actually *do* something â€” even if I barely know how they work yet.

## right now

- trying to understand how digital logic works, not just pass the lab
- writing buggy C code and slowly getting better at debugging myself
- experimenting with tools like Whisper just to see how far I can push my laptop
- learning guitar because sometimes it's nice to build something that doesnâ€™t crash

---

## some things I like

- circuits that blink
- code that breaks and teaches me something
- space tech and the idea of building for harsh environments
- the feeling when something finally works at 2 AM
- silence + headphones + figuring life out

## not looking for much

If you're learning too and just wanna talk or share cool stuff you're building (or breaking), feel free to message.

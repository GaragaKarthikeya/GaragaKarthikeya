👋 Hi, I’m @GaragaKarthikeya
I’m a fresher pursuing Integrated M.Tech (IMTech) in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at IIIT Bangalore. I'm passionate about exploring the vast fields of technology, engineering, and creativity, and I’m committed to making an impact through innovation and collaboration.

👀 I’m interested in...
VLSI Design & Digital Circuits: I have a growing passion for Verilog and VHDL, and I’m fascinated by the design and simulation of digital systems at the chip level. I’m excited to explore how electronics power the world, from FPGAs to complex integrated circuits.

Competitive Programming: I love problem-solving and logic challenges, especially in C programming and algorithm design. I’m currently building my programming skills through competitive coding events.

Space Technologies: I have a deep admiration for space exploration and dream of working with organizations like NASA to build technology that ventures into the stars. I want to explore how AI and hardware design can be used to advance space exploration.

AI and Machine Learning: As an enthusiast of AI and natural language processing (NLP), I’m particularly curious about the applications of GPT models and other machine learning algorithms in both space and communications technology.

Creative Engineering: I enjoy blending technical knowledge with creativity, whether it’s through writing, music, or digital art. I believe engineering is an art form, and I aim to bring creativity into everything I do, from coding to circuit design.

🌱 I’m currently learning...
Verilog and Digital Design: I’m actively working with tools like ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, and GTKWave to simulate and design hardware systems. I’m particularly interested in FPGA programming and chip-level design.

C Programming: As part of my coursework, I’m diving into C language basics, covering topics such as memory management, recursion, and data structures. This is essential for both my software development skills and my exploration of hardware-software integration.

Probability & Calculus: Mathematics is a crucial part of my academic journey. I’m deepening my understanding of probability theory and calculus, which are integral to both algorithm design and signal processing in electronics.

Physics for Space Applications: My dream of working with space technologies fuels my interest in physics and its applications to space. I’m learning about how electronics and communication systems are adapted for use in extreme environments like space.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
Open-Source Projects in VLSI and Digital Design: I’m eager to contribute to projects related to VLSI design, digital logic simulation, and hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog. I would love to work on FPGA-based projects and help design efficient, real-world digital systems.

Competitive Programming Projects: I’m also looking to collaborate on competitive coding projects where I can solve challenging algorithmic problems in C or Python.

Space Exploration Technologies: Whether it’s related to hardware, AI, or both, I’m highly interested in working with teams or individuals passionate about space tech. I’d love to explore ways we can bring new technologies to space missions.

Educational Content Creation: I’m passionate about making engineering concepts accessible to everyone. I would love to collaborate with people who create educational videos, tutorials, or blog posts about Verilog, digital design, or space tech.

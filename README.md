# About Me
I'm 18, studying **ECE at IIIT Bangalore**.  

Second year. Not an expert. Still learning every day.  

Mostly curious about how code and hardware connect. I like systems that actually *do* something — even if I barely know how they work yet.

# What I'm Working On
- **Electronics lab**: digital logic, circuits, microcontrollers  
- **Programming**: C++ for microcontroller work, Python for scripts, exploring web development  
- **Experiments**: trying out tools like Whisper and pushing my laptop to its limits  
- **Other side**: guitar practice (because sometimes it’s better when things don’t crash)

# Interests
- Circuits that blink  
- Code that breaks and teaches me something  
- Space tech and designing for harsh environments  
- That moment when something finally works at 2 AM  
- Quiet + headphones + figuring things out
